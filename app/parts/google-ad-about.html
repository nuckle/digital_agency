					<h3 class='google-ad-list__title'>Search Advertising</h3>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>These ads are shown to potential customers based on key queries entered into the Google search bar that the advertiser has added to their ad campaign.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Designed for people with a specific need or problem — essentially, it is a kind of response to a user’s search query in the form of a text message.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>This type of advertising is fundamental for generating “hot” traffic (people visiting the site) with an existing demand and readiness to buy.</p>

					<h3 class='google-ad-list__title'>Banner Advertising</h3>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Helps increase audience reach. It is shown on various Google partner information sites and appears as a static or dynamic banner with a commercial offer.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Ad displays can be highly customized: by social-demographic, age, and behavioral characteristics, user interests, and other criteria.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>This advertising is highly effective when you need to reach a large audience to increase brand, company, or product line awareness.</p>

					<h3 class='google-ad-list__title'>Video Advertising</h3>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Video advertising creates a brand image in the viewer's eyes, engaging them with a relatively low cost per contact with the target audience.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>This tool works well for increasing product recognition and creating a demand among potential customers.</p>

					<h3 class='google-ad-list__title'>Remarketing and Retargeting</h3>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Most people who visit your site typically need more than one visit to complete a targeted action (such as making a purchase).</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>The percentage of visitors who complete a targeted action on the first visit varies by business type but generally does not exceed 30%. What to do with the rest who just left? How to bring them back and convert them into customers? This is where remarketing comes in.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>Remarketing is used to bring back users who viewed your site or interacted with your ad but did not make a purchase, as well as to encourage repeat purchases.</p>
					<p class='google-ad-list__desc'>These users are usually more loyal, and the likelihood of them completing a targeted action is higher.</p>
